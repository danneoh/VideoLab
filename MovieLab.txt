I DID THE SATURATION EXTRA CREDIT. YOU JUST HAVE TO USE -sat TO ACTIVATE IT 
For this movielab i am able to create a movie from an image, and a movie from a movie.
The image to import is HSSOE.ppm and for the movie you can use any of the 3 movies we 
linked to our folders (e.g. mouse.yuv, hue.yuv, reverse.yuv). I also included the
saturation filter for the image to movie. The way you activate the saturation filter is 
to write "-sat" instead of "-hue" for the filter. The way you activate the filters for
movie to movie in my program is either "-reverse" to make it go backwards, or "-fast"
to speed up the move in which it will prompt the user on how fast they want it to go. 
The user can then input an int such as "2" to make it go twice as fast or "10," for 
example to make it go 10 times as fast.
